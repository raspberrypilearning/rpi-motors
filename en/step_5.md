## What next?

You could have your motor turn on using a [Motion Sensor](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-pir){:target="_blank"} when it senses motion, or make a controller with [Buttons](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-button-switch){:target="_blank"}!


If you are looking for a longer project that uses motors, you could try the [Robot Buggy](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-a-buggy){:target="_blank"} project. In this project, you will make a robot buggy that you can program to move around using simple Python commands!
